				<h3>Project Successes</h3>
            <ul>
				<li>Trained a binary classifier to use vibrational membrane frequency mode amplitude inputs to classify tiles of the moon based on whether they represent tightly bounded craters with
					an average accuracy of 96.9%, precision of 98.2%, and a sensitivity of 95.5%, yielding a Matthew's Correlation Coefficient of 0.938.</li>
				<li>Expanded on 2002 method for analysis of impact craters using eigenvalue expansion to include analysis of 1,500 lunar impact craters.</li>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
				<li>Wallis, D., & McBride, N. (2002). Planetary impact crater analysis with eigenfunction expansion. Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-8711.2002.05097.x</li></ul>
				<li>Implemented efficient closed-form calculation of minimum mean square error vibrational membrane fitting algorithm using linear algebra in TensorFlow with GPU acceleration.</li>
				<li>Performed preliminary exploration of optimal classification network architectures, found that networks with a single hidden layer of only 25 neurons could perform as described above.</li>
				<li>Using numerical methods, found preliminary evidence for feasibility of optimizing computational efficiency for calculation of eigenvalue expansions by producing an interpolable surface,
					which would eliminate the need to recalculate the eigenvalue expansion for every position of a sliding binary classifier window.</li>
				<li>Produced draft of manuscript documenting current state of work and results achieved such that it is ready for review by former professors at Stevens in preparation of potential submission of astronomy journals.</li>

				<h3>Project Failures</h3>
                    <ul>
						<li>Did not complete most recent attempt before graduation.</li>
						<li>Prior attempt had poor results, only achieving 74% recognition rate using raw digital elevation model data.</li>
                    </ul>
				<h3>Lessons Learned and Skills Developed</h3>
                    <ul>
						<li><b>Limitations of Machine Learning</b> - The initial attempt made during the summer of 2017 failed to achieve acceptable results, as it relied too heavily on a neural net to
						infer patterns in the data using relatively limited training samples. As a result, the network was large and had a tendency to overfit the training data while failing to generalize
						to samples in the separated test data. Understanding those limitations inspired a search for methods to reduce the input data's dimensionality, which resulted in discovery of
						a 2002 paper discussing the methods for crater analysis using eigenfunction expansion. The application of domain knowledge to this problem, i.e. that craters are generally circular and
						pit-shaped which makes them well approximated by vibrations of a circular membrane, allowed the reduction of the size of the classification network's input layer by several orders of
						magnitude without significant reduction of the shape information encoded in that input layer.</li>
						<li><b>Linear Algebra</b> - A course I took in Special and General Relativity involved rapidly teaching myself the basics of linear algebra in the process. In order to calculate the
							eigenfunction expansion of a discrete grid of values I had to apply linear algebra methods. Furthermore, understanding that the height chosen for the rim of the vibrational membrane used to
						approximate the shape of the crater would change the mean square error of that membrane led to utilization of calculus methods to determine the height for the membrane's rim that would
						minimize the mean square error.</li>
						<li><b>Incremental Research Validation</b> - Research is an open-ended process and as an independent researcher I have extremely limited human and computational resources, so it was
							important to develop strong justifications for every step taken to ensure those limited resources were spent efficiently. That importance was underscored by the relative opacity
							of neural nets to analysis and validation. To ensure that there was reason to believe a neural net could distinguish on the basis of eigenfunction expansions alone,
							I performed a study to determine whether there were significant differences between the eigenfunction expansions of digital elevation model tiles tightly bounding impact craters and
							random tiles of similar sizes. The results of that study justified investing further time and computational resources into implementing a binary classifier and calculating the
							eigenfunction expansions of 38,000 lunar digital elevation model tiles of varying sizes.</li>
						<li><b>LaTeX Typesetting Software</b> - Documenting the work performed, including the detailed derivation of calculations later implemented in TensorFlow required the use of LaTeX to
						format the equations and maintain the figure, table, and equation references in an efficient manner.</li>
                    </ul>
