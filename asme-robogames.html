				<h3>Project Successes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Attended RoboGames 2018 in Pleasanton, California.</li>
                <li>Completed mechanical fabrication of robot with limited access to machining resources, including
					development of a network of manufacturing subcontractors to meet specific needs.</li>
                <li>Demonstrated operational 3-degree-of-freedom swerve drive before RoboGames organizer deadline.</li>
				<li>Expanded American Society of Mechanical Engineers club membership to include 70 members, with 40 that made direct contributions to the final project.</li>
				<li>Successfully acquired $26,000 in cumulative support from Stevens Institute of Technology, including lodging.</li>
				<li>Found sources for all components required, substituting custom for off-the-shelf to extent possible, ensuring that spare parts were available.</li>
				<li>I developed and documented analytical methods to help team members estimate: </li>
				<ul style="list-style-type: circle">
					<li>Banking torque from rotation of spinning drum, to ensure that the robot wouldn't tip itself over during maneuvering with charged weapon.</li>
					<li>Impact force on weapon and armor from spinning weapon contact, to ensure that the armor and weapon were designed to withstand the forces incurred.</li>
					<li>Tipping model to determine required length and placement of self-righting arm so robot would not fail if it was flipped over.</li>
					<li>Turning friction model, to size stepper motor required for rotating wheels in swerve module.</li>
					<li>Rolling resistance model, to size hub motors required to drive swerve modules.</li>
					<li>Counterweight size and position for balancing eccentric rotating drum.</li>
					<lI>Bending strength of roof material, to inform material choice between low-carbon steel and polycarbonate.</lI>
				</ul>
				<li>Developed working initial version of driver training simulator, which was later expanded by a team member
					to include tactical combat elements. The latest version is included in additional media.</li>
				<li>Successfully shipped 1000 pound crate containing robot, support equipment, and hazardous materials, across the country twice.</li>
				<li>Carried out successful test of flipper arm, demonstrating first-ever self-righting combat robot made at Stevens.</li>
			</ul>
				<h3>Project Failures</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The electronic subsystems were not ready in time for competition, resulting in a failure to enter the arena.
							Problems with closed-loop control of stepper motors, specifically in faulty encoder readings at low swerve module rotation rates, were still being
							fixed by the time competition arose.</li>
						<li>Project ran over budget, requiring emergency budget negotiation from Dean Zu of the Schaefer School of Engineering.</li>
						<li>Staffing was not effectively handled during Spring Break, nearly resulting in project failure.</li>
                    </ul>
				<h3>Lessons Learned and Skills Developed</h3>
                    <ul>
						<li><b>Grant and Sponsorship Acquisition</b> - I negotiated for the budget for this project, including working directly with Stevens' committee for
						providing grants for student organizations, the Schaefer School of Engineering Dean, and the Mechanical Engineering department.
						Those partnerships led to the acquisition of $26,000 in direct support from	the institution.</li>
						<li><b>Machining Techniques and Limitations</b> - The limited machining resources available required careful design of components to minimize required
							machining time. To that end, I reviewed team designs and suggested changes to simplify fabrication without sacrificing functionality.</li>
						<li><b>Leadership and Team Management</b> - The team was composed of volunteers, and so I had to ensure that I maintained team morale even when the project was challenging.
							I was also involved in educating new team members regarding engineering methods, as many were undergraduate freshmen with minimal engineering experience.
						</li>
						<li><b>Value of Determination</b> - To meet the RoboGames competition organizer deadline for a demonstration of the operational drive system, two people were needed
						to work during Spring Break. A last minute failure from one team member to follow through on their commitment to work during that period left me alone to complete
						the necessary work. Instead of letting the project fail by missing the deadline, I doubled my work days from 8 hours to 16 hours and worked alone for the majority
						of the 5 days until the deadline was met. My only company during that experience was 5 hours of working with the project advisor, Dr. Eric Williams, after he returned
						from his abbreviated vacation, and short chats with the shop's janitorial staff. While physically and emotionally taxing to an extent that I was not aware I was
						capable of withstanding, the work I did during that time resulted in meeting the deadline and the team's subsequent trip to RoboGames in Pleasanton, California.</li>
						<li><b>Analytical Modeling</b> - I was responsible for the bulk of the analysis and modeling efforts, providing my team with the tools they needed to ensure that
						the designs they were producing would work when implemented.</li>
						<li><b>Supplier Networking</b> - Sourcing electronic, electromechanical, and mechanical components required finding and interacting with a diverse set of suppliers worldwide,
						including Australia, China, and the U.S. In total over 100 part orders were managed to acquire the necessary parts to complete the robot.</li>
						<li><b>Designing for Fabrication</b> - Custom parts needed to be minimized to ensure that spare parts could be acquired in the necessary quantities without
						overrunning in-house machining resource allocations. During design reviews, I focused on determining when custom parts were justified, such as for the spinning drum,
						and when they could be substituted for off-the-shelf components. I found ways to modify the design of the chassis and swerve modules
							to allow them to be assembled using only off-the-shelf and externally fabricated components, dramatically reducing construction
							time and allowing the completion of the mechanical fabrication in time for the competition.</li>
						<li><b>LaTeX Typesetting Software</b> - The analyses that I produced needed to be documented such that my team members could understand and extend my work. Given the
						extensive use of equations present in my work, learning LaTeX was necessary to produce intelligible documentation.</li>
						<li><b>Hazardous Material Shipping Procedures</b> - To comply with Federal Law regarding shipment of hazardous Lithium-Polymer batteries, I had to educate myself
						regarding appropriate paperwork and labelling of hazardous materials in preparation for shipping.</li>
						<li><b>Freight Logistics</b> - The robot and support equipment weighed 1000 pounds, so I needed to learn how to arrange for a round-trip freight shipment including
						interacting with the logistics personnel at both ends of the shipment.</li>
						<li><b>Sheet Metal Design</b> - The bulk of the robot was fabricated from sheet metal, including the swerve modules. In the process I learned about the process
						of designing sheet metal using a manufacturer handbook to allow me to take advantage of its ability to form robust and precise parts at low cost.</li>
                    </ul>
