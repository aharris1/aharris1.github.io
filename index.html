						<h3>2017-2018 RoboGames Heavyweight Combat Robot</h3>
						<p>Core members of the 2016-2017 Student Design Competition team were retained, and the team was expanded from 7 to 70 members. The budget was likewise expanded from $5,000 to $26,000 which I was responsible for successfully proposing, justifying, and managing. Electronics problems prevented the robot from being entered in any fights, but the team and I utilized the opportunity to solicit feedback on the design from more experienced builders, who praised the ambition but cautioned against complexity of the design given the team's inexperience and time limitations. The robot, corresponding documentation, and feedback has been passed on to younger team members for a renewed effort in the 2018-2019 academic year.</p>

									<h3>Research</h3>
									<h4>2015-2016 Biomodeling and Biomeasurements Laboratory: Thermoelectric Collector Plate</h4>
									<p>I joined the Biomodeling and Biomeasurements (BMBM) laboratory at Stevens Institute
										of Technology in spring of 2014 and worked with them until summer of 2016. My appointment
										to a project architect role in the Stevens American Society of Mechanical Engineers
										student chapter necessitated my departure from the BMBM laboratory.

									<h4>2016-2018 Independent Astronomy Research: <br>Crater Recognition Algorithm</h4>
									<p>From 2017 onwards I have been performing independent astronomy research to utilize
										a a neural net with a novel transformation layer
										for crater recognition. The crater recognition neural net
										I developed uses only 88 neurons, with a single hidden layer of 25 neurons. It has a recognition precision of <b>98.8%</b>, recall of <b>95.4%</b>, and
										an F1 score of <b>0.97</b> on a randomized test batch of 500 pre-identified craters and 500 random lunar tiles. To ensure
										that the metrics were not the result of overfitting, the test data was not shown to the network during training
										and the complexity of the neural net was minimized.

								<h3>Competitions</h3>
								<p>
									Wanting to fully leverage my combined software, mechanical, electronics, and leadership skill sets, in 2016 I accepted a
									Project Architect position in the Stevens American Society of Mechanical Engineers chapter. </p>
								<p>
									The limitations imposed by Stevens' limited in-house metalworking capacity required creative
									approaches for solving manufacturing problems in a timely manner. As a result, I developed a network of sheet metal and CNC
									contract manufacturers as well as versatile part suppliers to enable rapid prototyping and manufacturing of complex components.
								</p>
								<h4>2016-2017 ASME Student Design Competition: <br>Robot Pentathlon</h4>
								<p>
									I proposed and oversaw the new competition robotics initiative through negotiating
									for a $5,000 budget, then forming and leading a team of 7 undergraduates to compete
									in the 2016 Student Design Competition: Robot Pentathlon. The project required the
									design and fabrication of a robot that fit within a 50cm cubic bounding box with the
									ability to drive in a straight line, launch a tennis ball, hit a golf ball, climb stairs,
									and lift a weight that was itself designed and fabricated by the team.
								</p>
								<p>	A novel electromagnetic
									torque transmission system was considered for the entry, and I performed a feasibility
									study for that concept using a test platform I designed. Upon analysis of the data it
									was clear that the empirical evidence did not suggest feasibility, and so I informed my
									team that we would have to redesign the robot around more conventional concepts.
									As a result of the study I performed, the team and I had sufficient time to perform the
									redesign and were able to compete well enough to be awarded a <b>6th of 80</b> ranking at the national competition.
									<br><a href="asme-sdc.html"><i>Read more about ASME Student Design Competition: Robot Pentathlon project</i></a>
								</p>
								<h4>2017-2018 RoboGames Heavyweight Combat Robot</h4>
								<p> Utilizing the momentum from the prior year and my newly-won position as President of
									the Stevens ASME Chapter, in 2017 I negotiated for a $26,000 budget and recruited a
									team of 70 undergraduates for a RoboGames Heavyweight Combat Robotics competition run.
								</p>
								<p>
									Based on analysis of the current dominant designs in the competition, a novel three degree-of-freedom
									drive system was proposed and justified. A driving simulator was produced to provide
									training for the robot operators and feedback for the drive system designers. I derived
									analytical dynamics models from first-principles, which were used to produce a set of
									quantified specifications for the design of the subsystems. Quantifying the specifications
									early allowed the effective integration of subsystems and delegation of the design
									responsibility for those subsystems. To further enable effective delegation, I produced
									LaTeX documentation for my analytical models so they could be understood, extended, and utilized
									by the subteams as necessary to ensure they met the specifications I originally laid out.
								</p>
								<p>
									Furthermore, when difficult analysis problems arose during the course of the project,
									I would take responsibility for ensuring that they were approached from an analysis-first
									perspective and developed models when necessary to keep the project on schedule.
								</p>
								<p>
									Ultimately, while I was able to arrange for getting the team, robot, and associated 1000 pound
									crate to the competition in California, an electronics failure prevented the robot from
									being able to enter the ring. During the final week leading up to the competition, I
									worked with the electronics subteam to troubleshoot the cause of the electrical system failures.
									Unfortunately, those failures were not able to be rectified in time, and so in the
									interest of preserving the mechanical subsystems for future teams to work on, the
									robot was not permitted to enter the arena.

									<h3>Programming</h3>
									<p>
										I have used programming as a creative outlet for the past 16 years. The first language that I developed
										familiarity with was HTML, but I soon expanded to other programming languages with more versatile features.
									</p>
									<h4>Java</h4>
									<p>
										The language with which I have the most familiarity is Java. I have utilized Java to develop an entry for the
										EVE Online API Competition, which I coded in one week during March of 2015. I developed a graph-traversal algorithm
										that utilized data acquired from the newly-released RESTful API provided by the game developer CCP to plot
										routes with minimum danger and maximum profit for the player to traverse in-game. I was given an <b>Honorable Mention</b>
										for this project, and even received contributions to my codebase from a CCP game developer afterwards.
										<br>
										<a href="derp.html"><i>Read more about Dynamic Exploration Route Planner [Honorable Mention]</i></a>
									</p>
									<p>
										After the competition, I started development of a program that acquired even more data through the EVE Online API to optimize
										the supply chain for an in-game manufacturing business. Through the process, the underlying API architecture underwent
										three major changes, requiring the reworking of the interface codebase. Additionally, the scope of the project required
										careful architectural design, which was revised over three major versions until a working version was produced in 2018.
										<br>
									</p>
									<h4>Python</h4>
									<p>
										Python was the second programming language I taught myself, after HTML. In 2012 I utilized Python to
										develop an implementation of the Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSA) public-key encryption algorithm, as I
										was interested in understanding the underlying security framework of Secure Socket Layer, which provides
										internet uses with a means to authenticate websites and protects against data theft in transit.
										<br>
									</p>
									<p>
										I am currently utilizing Python to develop a crater recognition algorithm utilizing Google TensorFlow.
										I became interested in machine learning because of the potential to leverage the exponential growth
										of computational resources to push the state of the art in pattern recognition and data science.
										Crater recognition is an unsolved pattern recognition problem, and an efficient automated solution
										would provide more precise estimates of surface age and is the only means for the production of
										comprehensive catalogs of small craters.crater-recognition.html
										<br>
										<a href="crater-recognition.html"><i>Read more about Crater Recognition From Eigenvalue Expansion Parameters</i></a>
									</p>
									<h4>C#</h4>
									<p>
										In June of 2016 I was approached by a startup to provide mobile application programming services for a
										new real-time navigation application in the Xamarin framework. Xamarin was selected by the CTO because
										it permitted the same codebase to be compiled for use on Android, iOS, and Windows Phone. I rapidly familiarized
										myself with C# and was ready to take responsibility for the front-end design in one weekend. Limited funding
										for the startup limited my contract to 4 weeks, during which I provided a solution for the
										back-end developer to implement and a front-end to interface with it. The project is currently posted
										to GitHub at: https://github.com/mjcurry/SubwayPro.
										<br>
										<a href="subway-pro.html"><i>Read more about SubwayPro Mobile Application</i></a>
									</p>
									<p>
										The RoboGames Heavyweight Combat Robot required the development of a tactical driving simulator in order to
										test control schemes and driver ability before the completion of the physical robot. The Unity game engine was
										selected for this purpose due to its accessibility and short development cycle. The first
										version of the simulator was coded in C# and deployed for driver training in two weeks. The source code was
										shared with the team and later modifications by a talented team member provided multiplayer capabilities.
										<a href="WebGL/index.html"><i>See the RoboGames Heavyweight Combat Robot driving simulator</i></a>
									</p>
									<h4>HTML/Javascript</h4>
									<p>
										I developed familiarity with Javascript during the production of this website, and I utilized it to
										integrate interactive features into the individual project pages on this website.
                                        The format of this website is coded in HTML 5, which permits it
										to be hosted on a static hosting site.
									</p>
									<h4>MATLAB/Simulink</h4>
									<p>
										In 2016 I accepted a position as Design Laboratory Staff member, which included providing direct
										instruction to students in the production of MATLAB and Simulink models. I later used Simulink to
										set up intuitive differential equation solvers and MATLAB to visualize the solutions thereto.
									</p>
									<h4>Arduino-C</h4>
									<p>
										To program the microcontrollers for the mechatronics projects for my research
										and ASME Competition work, I had to teach myself Arduino-C. Notable work performed using
										that programming language included the development of a control system with a connection
										to a Python interface running on PC connected over USB for the Thermoelectric Collector Plate.
										<br>
										<a href="tec-collector.html"><i>Read more about Thermoelectric Collector Plate</i></a>
									</p>
									<p>
										Arduino-C was later used to implement a hierarchical control architecture for
										simultaneous closed-loop control of eight motor actuators for the RoboGames Heavyweight Combat Robot.
